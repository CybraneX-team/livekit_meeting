# 🚀 Quick Start Testing Guide

## **✅ API Tests Passed!**

The backend APIs are working correctly. Now let's test the frontend recording functionality.

## **🎯 Quick Test Steps**

### **Step 1: Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Wait for the server to start (usually at http://localhost:3000)

### **Step 2: Navigate to Meeting Room**
1. Open your browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Create or join a meeting room
4. Wait for the LiveKit connection to establish

### **Step 3: Test Recording Button**
1. **Look for the recording button** - it should show "Start Recording"
2. **Click "Start Recording"** - you should see:
   - Screen sharing permission dialog
   - Button changes to "Stop Recording"
   - Progress indicator appears (if recording)
   - Console logs showing multipart upload initialization

### **Step 4: Monitor Console Logs**
Open browser Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab for:
```
[DEBUG] Multipart upload initialized: {...}
[DEBUG] Uploading part 1, attempt 1, size: X bytes
[DEBUG] Successfully uploaded part: {...}
[DEBUG] Broadcasted recording status: start
```

### **Step 5: Test Recording Stop**
1. **Click "Stop Recording"** - you should see:
   - Recording name prompt
   - Button returns to "Start Recording"
   - Upload completion logs
   - Recording appears in list (if you have the recordings page)

## **🔍 What to Look For**

### **✅ Success Indicators**
- [ ] Recording button works without errors
- [ ] Screen sharing permissions granted successfully
- [ ] Progress indicators show upload progress
- [ ] Console shows multipart upload logs
- [ ] Recording completes without errors
- [ ] No memory leaks or crashes

### **❌ Common Issues**
- **"Failed to start recording"** - Check AWS S3 credentials
- **"Permission denied"** - Grant screen sharing permissions
- **"Upload failed"** - Check network connection and S3 configuration
- **No progress updates** - Check console for chunk upload logs

## **📊 Performance Check**

### **Expected Behavior**
- Recording starts within 3 seconds
- Progress updates every 30 seconds
- Upload completes reliably
- No browser freezing or memory issues

### **Memory Usage**
- Monitor browser Performance tab
- Should not see continuous memory growth
- Recording should not cause browser crashes

## **🎯 Next Steps**

### **If Tests Pass:**
1. ✅ **System is working correctly**
2. 🚀 **Ready for production deployment**
3. 📈 **Can proceed with Phase 3 & 4 enhancements**

### **If Tests Fail:**
1. 🔧 **Check environment variables**
2. 🔧 **Verify AWS S3 configuration**
3. 🔧 **Check browser console for errors**
4. 🔧 **Refer to TESTING_GUIDE.md for detailed troubleshooting**
